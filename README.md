## How to use the Expedia & Hotels Review Scraper?

Apify Console is a perfect tool to use web scrapes as you don't need to go deep to technical details to received needed data. To start using the web scraper, do the following:

1. [Create an account](https://console.apify.com/sign-up) in Apify Console. 
2. Open the [Expedia & Hotels Review Scraper](https://apify.com/tri_angle/expedia-hotels-com-reviews-scraper) actor [^firstnote].
3. In the **Expedia or Hotels.com URLs** section, add as many accomodation URLs, as you want to get reviews for. 
4. Click **Save & Start** [^secondnote]. The actor starts collecting information.
5. Wait until the run gets the **Successfull* status, and open the **Output** tab to see the results.

### Input

You can either paste the accomodation URL and set up search criteria in settings, or use the JSON request. 

```
{
    "maxReviewsPerHotel": 100,
    "sortBy": "Most recent",
    "startUrls": [
        {
            "url": "https://euro.expedia.net/Rome-Hotels-Hotel-Quirinale.h1058.Hotel-Information",
            "method": "GET",
            "userData": {
                "hotel": "Hotel Quirinale",
                "doWeEndorseIt": "no opinion"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

[^firstnote]: The web scraper is currently named a bit differently, but I decided to stick to my version all over the README. 
[^secondnote]: Once a user changes anything in the URL fields, the button renames as **Save & Start**. When a user opens the actor for the first time, he definitely needs to insert his URLs, so it would be the correct name of the button in this procedure.
